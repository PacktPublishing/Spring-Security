## Section 7 - Spring Security ACL

- **Video 1** - `Introduction to Domain Object Security`
- **Video 2** - `ACL Data Structure`
- **Video 3** - `ACL With Spring Security`
- **Video 4** - `Advanced ACL`

- note that `Video 1` and `Video 2` do not have corresponding projects on github - `Video 1` is the introduction to ACL and `Video 2` focuses on the database structure
- also note that the full SQL files are [located here](https://github.com/eugenp/course/tree/master/section7/s7_vid4/src/main/sql) (in the `Video 3/4` projects)
