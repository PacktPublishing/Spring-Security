# Spring Security [Video]
This is the code repository for [Spring Security [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-security-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781782168652), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Secure a standard Java web application with Spring Security by implementing registration and authentication processes and setting up the Remember Me mechanism. This course shows you how to leverage the powerful authorization mechanisms available and allows you to grasp the full flexibility of Spring expressions. Learn how to secure the REST API of this application and how to set up the advanced ACL Authorization for practical application.

This video course will help you secure your web application with the use of highly practical examples. You will also learn how to implement security checks, thus enabling you to create a staunch authentication mechanism that will prevent spoofing. Integrate with LDAP and progress on to more advanced security techniques such as Remember Me or the powerful ACL mechanism.

These pragmatic videos will help you learn how to implement various techniques for securing your web application through the use of simple to advanced use cases that follow the development of a web application using practical, step-by-step examples.

Each video section shows different ways to empower Spring Security for the web. The authentication techniques comprising of login, registration, and logout are implemented in this course. Moreover, the Remember Me functionality is added to the web app in addition to integration with a production-ready LDAP server. Further on, the authorization method is used and discussed in detail with simple roles, before moving on to the more flexible Spring expressions and finally the extremely powerful Access Control Lists mechanism, which allow security rules per object.

Ultimately, this video course is meant to help you hit the ground running with proper security for your web applications. The primary goal of the course is to be efficient, utilitarian, and immediately applicable for a web application.


This course teaches you the key aspects of this flexible data store. You’ll learn how a NoSQL data store such as Redis differs from traditional SQL databases that you may be more familiar with. You’ll see how to install the database on your own machine, or use a database provider in the cloud. You’ll also discover the basic native data types of Redis and how to use them.

From theory to application, Rapid Redis explains when, why, and how to use the Redis data store. We’ll discuss the differences between NoSQL and SQL, explore the Redis data types to see how to use them, and end up with an easy-to-understand Node.js example app that uses Redis as a cache.

No matter what kind of application you’re working on, you need a place to store your data. Rapid Redis gives you a new tool to add to your toolbox: a data store that is quick and easy to use, and far more powerful than you can imagine.

<LI>Integrate and set up Spring Security to talk to LDAP 
<LI>Map both the users and the authorities/roles and finish with some advanced scenarios 
<LI>Explore practical usages of Spring Expressions, from securing full pages by their URL to securing elements within a page and finally securing business functionality in the Service Layer 
<LI>Implement the security of a REST API and learn how to set up both basic and advanced authentication processes. 
<LI>Learn how to utilize Spring Security for higher levels of security scenarios including the Access Control Lists for all domain entities in the application 
<LI>Learn how to spot potential design flaws that can make an application vulnerable and how to address these concerns by using and adapting the highly flexible Spring Security framework to your own environment and security need. </LI></UL></DIV>
